# ProbingEnvironments
ProbingEnvironments is a library that provides Reinforcement Learning Environments allowing for easy debugging of DeepRL actor-critic algorithms.

The goal of this library is either :
- To use the environments yourself to check your agent by hand
- To include the premade tests in your units tests, allowing to check your agent without relying on long training tests on more complex environments
